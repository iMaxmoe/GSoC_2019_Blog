Hello everyone!

It is a great pleasure to introduce myself to all of you. I am Gulshan Kumar from International Institute of 
Information Technology, Hyderabad India. I am a 3rd year undergraduate student pursuing my B.Tech in Computer 
Science and M.S by research in IIIT Hyderabad, India. My specific research domain is Computer Vision, Robotic Vision and 
Natural Language Processing.

The following list of blog posts will be related to **Google Code of Summer**'s project : **Rapid Annotator 2**, and a detailed account of my adventures, what I learned in the months May through August, obstacles I faced and how finally I overcame those.

I by and large attempt to deliver as per documented in the GSoC Timeline in the proposal. I will endeavor to record each one of the deviations from the solutions / approaches as proposed and settled on in the proposal.
